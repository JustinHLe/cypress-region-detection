# Overview

Testing of Applied Medical's EU corporate site, appliedmedical.eu, using cypress. 

The site's content is determinant on the user's location in the world. For example, when accessing appliedmedical.eu, a user from France might see different content or
may be restricted to content as opposed to a user from the Netherlands. This can making testing the website very difficult, because a VPN will be required to test across
different regions. To simplify the process of testing we utilized cypress. Cypress is basically a javascript tool that can automate and create tests that simulate an 
actual human being.
